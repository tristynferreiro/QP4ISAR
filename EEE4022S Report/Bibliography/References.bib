   abstract = {This paper describes the design and working principles of an experimental multimode radar with a stepped-frequency Synthetic Range Profiling (SRP) and Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) capability for the purpose of operator-based classification of small to medium sized sea vessels in littoral condition. The experimental multimode radar is based on an experimental tracking radar that was modified to generate SRP and ISAR images in both search and tracking modes. The architecture and functionality of the experimental system is described. Initial results from field experiments are presented to demonstrate the functionality of the system. © 2011 IEEE.},
