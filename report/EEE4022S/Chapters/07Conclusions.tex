% Characteristics of the conclusion section: 
% •	Should not introduce new results that were not discussed in the main body of the report 
% •	The conclusions should be aligned with the interpretation of the data in the results section
% •	The conclusions should be linked with the objectives of the work
% •	The conclusion should be concise and accurate

% Flow of the conclusion
% •	Begin with the high-level context and objectives
% •	Gradually get into the technical details of your design, implementation, experiment, and results analysis
% •	Finally, spiral back up to how you did/didn’t meet the objectives and how the results fit into the broader context you originally described.  
% •	The audience needs reminding of why you did what you did and what the relevance of your results are.

% The future work section should offer useful and creative suggestions for future research
