\section{Background}
% Background: should provide answers to the following questions
% •	What are the real-life applications of the work or the bigger project?
% •	Why is the work important?
% •	Who are the potential users and how would their view impact your work?
% •	Discussion on experimental and commercial systems that have been published in the literature to contribute towards the real-life application identified earlier




\section{Problem Statement}

%Problem statement
%folder 11, file 1, drafiting flow of intorduction
%ISAR applications: classify sea vessels, maritime surveillance, 
%Background: 
%Quickview processor used to check if good quality data during data capturing
%Why do we need it in terms of tracking
%Not much work done into the field


% Problem statement:
% •	Identifying the challenges in this broad research topic
% •	Brief discussion on what work has been done in the literature to address these challenges
% •	Identifying where insufficient work has been done to full address specific challenges
% •	Clarifying the problem addressed in your work. The problem should be clear and achievable within the project
% •	What are the benefits that can be achieved with this work?
\section{Objectives}
% Objectives
% •	Each objective needs to be concise, clear, achievable in the scope of the work, engaging
% •	Ensure that each objective is linked to the problem statement



\section{Scope \& Limitations}
% Project scope
% •	Clarifying where the current project fits in the bigger project
% •	Clearly state what is within the scope of the work
% •	Clearly state what is outside the scope of the work
- only focuses on RA and AF part of ISAR imaging and not other processes required to form clear ISAR images. This limits the quality (focus) of the image produced.
